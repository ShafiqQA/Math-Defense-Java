# Math Defense: The Box Sorter 🚀

An interactive educational game developed in **Java** using the **Swing** framework. This project challenges students to solve mental math problems under pressure using strategic planning.

## 🌟 Key Features
* **Dynamic Difficulty Scaling**: Target sums and number ranges increase every 3 waves to maintain an educational challenge.
* **Boss Level Mechanics**: Every 6 boxes, players face a high-stakes "Boss Level" requiring 10-slot mathematical decomposition.
* **Look-Ahead Validation**: An internal logic engine prevents "unsolvable" states by calculating the math of future moves before spawning numbers.
* **Health & Time Management**: Real-time feedback via a custom UI with health bars and countdown timers.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Language**: Java
* **Graphics**: Java Swing / AWT (Graphics2D)
* **Engine**: Custom 60FPS Game Loop using `javax.swing.Timer`
* **Version Control**: Git-managed repository with professional cleanup and .gitignore practices

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ShafiqQA/Math-Defense-Java.git`
2. Compile: `javac src/MathDefense.java`
3. Run: `java src.MathDefense`
